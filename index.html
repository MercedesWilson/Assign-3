      <p>Hi! I’m Mercedes and am currently studying Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo. During my childhood I grew up as a missionary kid in Guatemala which has shaped me into who I am today. My family and I worked at an orphanage called ‘James Project of Latin America’ in which we lead several teams from North America to serve the kids that lived on site. As a kid I always had a mindset that if I was uncomfortable it means I was pushing myself and making myself a better person, so I began living by a motto “You have to be uncomfortable in order to become comfortable”. In doing so, this unique experience has taught me leadership, translation, and missional work. </p>
       
      <p>Living cross-culturally sparked my passion for helping those in need and has inspired me to study in a field in business in the hopes of launching a nonprofit that builds supportive communities around the world. I would love to create a space for children and mothers that offers family, friendship, and connection to those who need it most.</p>
       
      <p>Upon moving back to Canada in 2019, it has become of particular interest to create art with the hopes of selling it one day at art galleries so I can share my story globally to spread awareness about the vulnerability that is just below North America.</p>
